                    <p>  Our property is a discreet, reasonably priced standalone

                        downtown, the Fair Grounds (home of Jazz Fest), and City Park.
                        The 400 square foot guest house has a sitting room, small kitchen,
                        and full bathroom. The residence feels roomier because of the
                        exceptionally high ceilings. The sofa can also be made into a bed. We have
                        a lovely porch/deck to sit on and have a glass of Merlot, as
                        well as a handcrafted counter area that gives character to the space

                                    Fantastic place. It was clean, Adrienne was great (even
                                    though we did not meet in person) and everything went super
                                    smooth. Location is also greate if you like running and 
                                    something a bit more quiet. I would suggest a car or take
                                    into consideration that you might have to Uber into the 
                                    city from the location. Overall, would recommend the place
                                    anytime.
